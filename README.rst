 Renku-UI
================

*The Renku platform is under very active development and should be considered highly
volatile.*

Quickstart
----------

The Renku ui depends on a running instance of Renku being present. More precisely,
it relies on a running instance of the
`Renku Gateway <https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-gateway>`_
that acts as an interface to all backend services APIs, handling authentication
and exchanging access tokens.
Clone the main Renku repository and follow these instructions_ to get Renku up
and running.
You can also deploy an environment in a remote development cluster.

.. _instructions: https://renku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to-guides/admin/index.html

Developing the UI
-----------------
Once you have a development instance of Renku running locally or in the cloud,
you can install telepresence_ locally and run the ``run-telepresence.sh`` script
in the `client` or the `server` folder. Don't forget to run `npm install` before
running telepresence for the first time or after any package change.

::

    $ cd client   # or server if you need to work there
    $ npm install
    $ ./run-telepresence.sh

Telepresence replaces the selected UI pod in the target Kubernetes instance. All the
traffic is then redirected to a local process, making all the changes to files almost
immediately available in your development RenkuLab instance.

The ``run-telepresence.sh`` scripts support out-of-the-box telepresence_ minikube and
the Renku team `switch-dev` cloud. You need to properly set the environment variable
``CURRENT_CONTEXT`` to either ``"minikube"`` or ``"switch-dev"``.

There are a few other environment variables you may want to set when starting telepresence
if you are going to to take advantage of the Renku team internal development infrastructure:

- SENTRY: set to `1` to redirect the exceptions to the dev sentry_ deployment
- PR: set to the target PR number in the renku-ui_ repo to work in the corresponding CI deployment

::

    $ SENTRY=0 PR=1166 ./run-telepresence.sh

There are other variables used in the ``run-telepresence.sh`` script. For specific use
cases, you may want to modify some values manually.

Tests
-----

We use jest_ as our default testing framework and eslint_ as linter.
Mind that we require both commands to terminate without warnings before we merge a PR.
You can manually run tests using the following commands:

::

    $ cd client   # or server if you need to work there
    $ npm test
    $ npm run lint

Some linting errors can be automatically fixed by running ``npm run lint-fix``. We suggest
using an IDE that supports eslint (like vscode_ or similar) to get realtime feedback
when modifying the code.
