            The change you will most immediately notice is the new look. There
            is a new logo, a new color palette, and a cleaner visual style. We
            think you will like the new appearance of RenkuLab.

          <h3 className="rk-pt-s">Better Sessions</h3>
          <p>
            Sessions (previously &ldquo;Interactive Environments&rdquo;) have
            been dramatically redesigned. You can now start sessions at the
            click of a button, and we have made it easier to access information
            and documentation while working within a session.

          <h3 className="rk-pt-s">Clearer Context</h3>
          <p>
            RenkuLab has always integrated GitLab, and we have made it easier
            and more intuitive to access. Take full advantage of the power of
            GitLab without losing track of the RenkuLab context.
