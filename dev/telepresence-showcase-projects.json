Hybrid pixel detectors show great potential for use in Electron Microscopy, but poor spatial resolution - caused by large pixel size and multiple scattering in the sensor layer - are holding them back. The goal is to use Machine Learning trained on simulation and measurement data to improve spatial resolution by determining the point where the electron hits the detector and assigning the signal to the correct pixel.",
